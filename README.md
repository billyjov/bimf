# Bundle-Independent Micro-Frontend Demo

This repository showcases a **Micro-Frontend** implementation
using **RsPack**, a high-performance bundler for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

## Overview

Micro-Frontends enable you to break down a large frontend application into smaller, independently deliverable units. This demo leverages RsPackâ€™s blazing-fast build capabilities to demonstrate:

- Sharing components between micro-frontends.
- Independent builds for each micro-frontend.
- A seamless user experience with dynamic module federation.

## Features

- **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: Modularize your frontend into independently deployed applications.
- **Dynamic Module Federation**: On-the-fly loading of shared components and dependencies.
- **Blazing Performance**: Build and serve using RsPack for faster iteration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 20 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies for all micro-frontends:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the demo application:

```bash
npm run start
```

Each micro-frontend will be served locally, and the host application will combine them seamlessly.

### Build for Production

To build the micro-frontends for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready assets will be output to the `dist/` directory.

## How It Works

1. **Independent Micro-Frontends**: Each micro-frontend is a standalone application with its own RsPack configuration.
2. **Module Federation**: The host app dynamically loads remote modules from each micro-frontend.
3. **Shared Components**: Common dependencies (e.g., React) and utilities are shared to minimize duplication.

## Key Scripts

- **`npm run start`**: Starts the development servers for all micro-frontends and the host application.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the production-ready assets.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase.

## Technologies Used

- **[RsPack](https://www.rspack.dev/)**: Fast and efficient JavaScript bundler.
- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **Module Federation**: For implementing micro-frontends.
